I am a AI research scientist at [GE Healthcare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/). My research largely focuses on (deep) probabilistic machine learning methods for healthcare applications, specifically for sequential and multi-modal settings. Prior to joining GE Healthcare, I was a statistics PhD student at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/) under the advisement of [Dr. Padhraic Smyth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/) and [Dr. Stephan Mandt](http://www.stephanmandt.com/).  
While there, my research primarily pertained to investigating efficient methods of evaluating various probablistic queries of black-box sequential models (e.g., large language models, temporal point processes, etc.) that extend beyond immediate next value prediction. 

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to research these topics and others during my PhD due to receiving a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship in 2020. Prior to starting my PhD program, I received a Bachelor's of Science degree in software engineering with a minor in data science at the [California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo](https://www.calpoly.edu/) under the advisement of [Dr. Dennis Sun](https://dlsun.github.io/). I have also conducted machine learning research as an intern at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/about-microsoft-research/), and [NVIDIA](https://nv-adlr.github.io/).
